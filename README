Purpose:
    To design primers for targeted cDNA seq for fusion detection 
      or targeted gDNA seq for mutation (SNV, Indel, CNV) detection 
      using anhcored multiplex PCR.

1. Check out 'main.R' for useage.

2. Required software, R library and data dependency

 1) Primer3 (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/primer3_manual.htm)
 2) BLAT (https://users.soe.ucsc.edu/~kent/src/)
 3) R libraries: BSgenome.Hsapiens.UCSC.hg19
                SNPlocs.Hsapiens.dbSNP.20111119
 4) The dependency data (e.g. ~/dependency-AMP/)

The dependecy data (e.g. in '~/dependency-AMP') should contain:

  hg19.2bit                   - contains the complete hg19 Human Genome in the 2bit (Available from
	                          http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/bigZips/hg19.2bit)

  NGSadaptors_and_humanRep.fa - contains sequences used for filtering primers during primer3 design.
				It cosists of:
			        a) NGS adaptors (supplied by this pipeline 'NGSadaptors.fa')
				b) Human repetitive seqeunce (available from
				     http://www.girinst.org/server/RepBase/index.php, which
			             requires registration [free for non-profit])
			        To create, run:
        			   cat NGSadaptors.fa humrep.fasta > 
					/path/to/dependency/NGSadaptors_and_humanRep.fa

  dbsnp/                      - dbSNP and clinically relevant SNPs from the 1000 Genomes Project 
				  (20120626 Release). dbSNPs are split by chromosome and saved as
				  snp.1, snp.2, ...snp.Y, such as:
				 zzlion@tnaseq:~/dependency-AMP/dbsnp$ head -n2 snp.1
					"V1" "V2" "V3" "V4" "V5"
					"1" "1" 10583 "rs58108140" "G" "A"
					"2" "1" 10611 "rs189107123" "C" "G"
				(the complied dbsnp.tar.gz file will be uploaded to a public 
				sever soon)
